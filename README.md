# Cholera Cases, Deaths, and CFR in AFRO Countries (1970 - 2024)

## Overview

This Shiny application provides an interactive platform for visualizing cholera cases, deaths, and the case fatality ratio (CFR) in countries within the World Health Organization's African Region (AFRO) from 1970 to 2024. The application allows users to explore data for individual countries, with the ability to toggle between different metrics, including cases, deaths, and CFR (with 95% confidence intervals).

## Data Sources

The data used in this application comes from three key sources:

1. **Our World in Data (1970-2021)**: [Number of Reported Cases of Cholera (1949-2021)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-reported-cases-of-cholera) and the [Number of Reported Deaths of Cholera from (1949-2021)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-reported-cholera-deaths)
2. **WHO Annual Report 2022**: Data extracted from the World Health Organization's [Weekly Epidemiological Record](https://www.who.int/publications/journals/weekly-epidemiological-record) No 38, 2023, 98, 431â€“452.
3. **Global Cholera and Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) Dashboard (2023-2024)**: [WHO Global Cholera and AWD Dashboard](https://who-global-cholera-and-awd-dashboard-1-who.hub.arcgis.com/)

These sources provide comprehensive data on cholera cases, deaths, and other related metrics for countries within the AFRO region.
